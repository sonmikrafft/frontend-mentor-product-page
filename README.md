## My process

### Built with

- HTML, SCSS, JS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webstorm with Simple Hot Reload Server (install: `npm install -g simple-hot-reload-server`, start: `hrs`) and File Watcher with SCSS for building CSS

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

- Instead of using the ID, just use the class
```js
const cartContent = document.querySelector(".cart__content");
```

### Continued development

It's a lot of code and it has a lot of duplicated code. Refactor!
